        <p>
          LightCore is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help you
          understand the connections between your daily activities, your sleep,
          and your overall well-being. By keeping a brief daily log, you provide
          the app with the data it needs to become your "bio-digital twin,"
          reflecting your body's patterns and rhythms over time.

        <h2>How to Use LightCore: A Quick Guide</h2>

        <h4>1. The Daily Log & Sleep Data (Center & Right Columns)</h4>
        <p>
          This is your main daily input. In the large text box, write a few
          sentences about your day. What did you do? How did you feel? What did
          you eat? The more detail, the better the insights will be. On the
          right, add the hours you slept and rate the quality of your sleep from
          1 (poor) to 5 (excellent).
        </p>

        <h4>2. AI Analysis (Center Column)</h4>
        <p>
          After you submit your log, our AI gets to work. It reads your entry
          and provides three key scores: <strong>Mental Clarity</strong>,
          <strong>Immune Risk</strong>, and <strong>Physical Output</strong>. It
          also provides brief notes explaining its reasoning. This gives you an
          instant snapshot of your readiness for the day.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Trend Charts (Left Column)</h4>
        <p>
          The charts on the left visualize your scores over the last 7 or 30
          days. This is where you can see patterns at a glance. Are you trending
          up or down? Did a few nights of poor sleep impact your mental clarity?
          The charts make these connections obvious.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Recent Entries (Center Column)</h4>
        <p>
          This table shows a history of your recent logs. For a quick overview,
          you can see the scores for each day. If you want to see the full
          details of a specific entry—including your original log text and the
          AI's notes—simply click on the row to open the full view.
        </p>

        <h4>5. AI Insight & History (Right Column)</h4>
        <p>
          The "AI Insight" card is where LightCore truly shines. After you've
          logged a few entries, the AI will start to find deeper correlations in
          your data. It might notice that your physical output is always higher
          after a good night's sleep, or that your mental clarity dips when you
          mention feeling stressed. These insights are saved in the "Insight
          History" so you can review them anytime.
