            <h3>The Lightcore Brain: A System That Learns You</h3>
            <p>
                At the center of the platform is the <strong>Lightcore Brain Context</strong>‚Äîa persistent, evolving memory unique to you. It's more than just a database; it's a dedicated AI consciousness that learns from every interaction.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>It Remembers:</strong> The Brain maintains a running summary of your health journey and its own internal "memos" on what to watch for next.</li>
                <li><strong>It Synthesizes:</strong> It combines your conversational logs, sleep data, automated health metrics (like steps from Google Health), and timed events into a single, unified context.</li>
                <li><strong>It Evolves:</strong> The guidance you receive today is informed by everything you've logged before, ensuring insights become deeper and more personalized over time.</li>

            <h3>Proactive Intelligence, Not Just Passive Tracking</h3>
            <p>
                LightCore features two powerful, automated systems that work for you in the background, powered by the Lightcore Brain:
            </p>
            <div class="feature-box">
                <h4>The Trend Sentinel üõ°Ô∏è</h4>
                <p>This system actively monitors your data 24/7. If it detects a significant, stable downward trend in any of your core metrics, it automatically generates and sends you an intelligent "nudge" with suggested actions‚Äîhelping you course-correct before a small dip becomes a major issue.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-box">
                <h4>The Correlation Engine üß†</h4>
                <p>LightCore actively searches for the hidden "cause and effect" patterns in your life. It analyzes the relationship between the timing of your events (like a late-afternoon coffee) and your health scores (like sleep quality or next-day clarity) to deliver specific, actionable insights you might never have noticed on your own.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>The Vision: An Evolving Digital You</h3>
            <p>
                Every log you create enriches your Bio Digital Twin, making it smarter. The ultimate vision is to move from analysis to forecasting. A mature digital twin will help you run simulations on future decisions, providing predictive insights to help you navigate your life with more certainty and clarity.
