      <p class="muted">Effective: 17 Aug 2025</p>
      <p>
        LightCore helps you build a personal wellness “bio digital twin.” You can choose between a
        classic dashboard and a 3D Neural-Cortex view—both show the same underlying data.
        This policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.
      </p>
      <p class="callout small">
        We don’t sell your data. We store the minimum needed to run the app and give you in-app controls
        to export and delete your data.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account:</strong> We use Supabase for sign-in. We don’t see your password (it’s handled by Supabase).</li>
        <li><strong>Your logs:</strong> Text you enter plus derived scores (clarity, immune, physical readiness). Optional “events” may be extracted from a log (e.g., “Workout @ 7:30am”).</li>
        <li><strong>Settings:</strong> Your UI preference (Neural-Cortex or Classic) is saved to your profile and also in local storage so it feels “sticky.”</li>
        <li><strong>Google Health (optional):</strong> If you connect, we store the Google OAuth tokens only to fetch today’s step count. We do not store historical steps; we read the current day on demand and show it.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Database rows are protected with Row-Level Security (RLS) so you only ever access your own data.</li>
        <li><strong>Control:</strong> You can export or delete your data from inside the app. Disconnect Google Health at any time.</li>
      </ul>

        <h2>What we collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account info:</strong> Email address. Authentication is managed by Supabase; passwords are not visible to us.</li>
          <li><strong>Profile:</strong> Preferred UI (<span class="badge">neural</span> or <span class="badge">classic</span>), timestamps.</li>
          <li><strong>Daily logs:</strong> Text you enter and AI-derived fields such as clarity/immune/physical scores and notes.</li>
          <li><strong>Events (optional):</strong> Structured items parsed from a log (e.g., “Caffeine 9:10am”).</li>
          <li><strong>Nudges:</strong> Insight cards generated by your data; whether you acknowledged them.</li>
          <li><strong>Google Health (optional):</strong> OAuth access + refresh tokens and expiry, limited scope to step counts; current day’s step total displayed on request.</li>
          <li><strong>Device data:</strong> Your browser’s IANA timezone (e.g., “America/Chicago”) so “today” steps match your local day.</li>
          <li><strong>Local storage:</strong> A small key to remember your UI preference and support smoother routing.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>How we use it</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Run the app:</strong> Authenticate you, show your logs, trends, and guidance.</li>
          <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Honor your chosen dashboard (Classic vs Neural-Cortex).</li>
          <li><strong>Health integration (optional):</strong> Fetch your <em>current day</em> step count from Google Fit in your local timezone.</li>
          <li><strong>Quality & safety:</strong> Keep the service secure (e.g., prevent unauthorized access via RLS).</li>
          <li><strong>Support:</strong> Help troubleshoot if you contact us.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-party services</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Supabase</strong> (database & auth) — stores your data and enforces Row-Level Security.</li>
          <li><strong>Netlify</strong> (hosting & serverless functions) — runs the backend endpoints we call from the app.</li>
          <li><strong>Google Fit</strong> (optional) — provides your step counts when you connect Google Health.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">
          These providers process your data on our behalf and transmit it over HTTPS. Your Google tokens are used only to read today’s steps and can be revoked at any time.

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Google Health details</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Scope:</strong> We request the minimal Google Fit scope to read step counts (<code>com.google.step_count.delta</code>).</li>
          <li><strong>Tokens:</strong> We store access/refresh tokens and their expiry in your <code>user_integrations</code> row to call Google’s API; if expired, we refresh them (when configured).</li>
          <li><strong>No step history stored:</strong> We do not persist daily step history in our database; the current day’s total is fetched and shown to you.</li>
          <li><strong>Timezone:</strong> The step window (start/end of “today”) is computed from your device’s IANA timezone.</li>
          <li><strong>Disconnect:</strong> Toggle off in “Connected Services” to delete the integration row; you can also revoke access in your Google Account settings.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Row-Level Security (RLS):</strong> Each query is scoped so you can only read or change your own rows.</li>
          <li><strong>Transport & storage:</strong> Data is sent over HTTPS. Our providers encrypt data at rest.</li>
          <li><strong>Least privilege:</strong> The app requests only the permissions required to function.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">No system can be 100% secure, but we design LightCore to minimize data collection and exposure.</p>

        <h2>Your choices & rights</h2>
        <ul>

          <li><strong>Google tokens:</strong> Stored only while you’re connected; removed when you disconnect or delete your account.</li>
          <li><strong>Local storage:</strong> UI preference can be cleared by your browser or by switching views.</li>

        <p>
          Our providers may process data in the United States or other regions where they operate data centers.
