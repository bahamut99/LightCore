                <li>Create and manage your account.</li>
                <li>Provide the core service of tracking your health metrics.</li>
                <li>Generate personalized insights and guidance using Google's Gemini AI model. Your anonymized log text is sent for analysis to produce scores and notes.</li>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
            We use <a href="https://supabase.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supabase</a> as our backend and database provider. Supabase implements industry-standard security measures to protect your data. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            We use Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model to analyze your log entries. When you submit a log, the text of that log is sent to Google's API for processing. We do not send your email or any other personally identifiable information with this request. The analysis results (scores and notes) are then stored in our database.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
        <p>
            We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information or health data to outside parties. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our Service (like Supabase and Google AI), so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.
        </p>
        
        <h2>7. Administrator Access to Data</h2>
        <p>
            We have a strict internal policy regarding your data. While authorized administrators of the Service may have the technical ability to access user data stored in our database for the purpose of system maintenance or troubleshooting, we will not view your individual log entries or personal information unless it is strictly necessary to provide you with technical support or as required by law. Your privacy is paramount.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Your Data Rights</h2>
